HackTheBox Writeups

Hints, full walkthrough and fun facts!

I like explaining certain concepts, like what SSH is, how directory busting works, etc. in my walkthroughs. I'm new to this, and I think that kind of info is useful. If you think that is redundant, you can simply skip italic portions of my reports...and honestly, if you're that COOL, can't you just root the machines yourself? HUH?! You should be teaching me! Anyways that's a thing...

## Some notes 
* I will add to these once I complete more machines, or when I am revisiting machines that I have previously completed.
