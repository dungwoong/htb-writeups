HackTheBox Writeups for Beginners

Hints, full walkthroughs and fun facts!

For each machine, you should find
* hints
* full walkthrough
* explanation of process

These guides are made for n00bs. I explain common concepts and methodologies in the writeups.

## Some notes 
* I will add to these once I complete more machines, or when I am revisiting machines that I have previously completed.
* I try to keep the tone conversational, but my conversational tone is kind of sarcastic...so...have fun!
